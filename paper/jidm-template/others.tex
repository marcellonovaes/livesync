Crowdsourced Automatic Zoom and Scroll for Video Retargeting \cite{carlier2010crowdsourced} uses the crowd to identify focusing regions of a video. Viewers select a zoom area that focuses important content from the video, so when the video is watched in low resolution screens, only most important content is presented to users.

Introducing game elements in crowdsourced video captioning by non-experts, \cite{kacorri2014introducing} presents the use of game elements (gamification) in a crowdsourcing platform. In this case, the problem that needs to be solved is generating captions for multiple videos. The most significant about this paper is the use of video segments. This allows users to perform small tasks to achieve a greater goal. Gamification aspects are important as an incentive to participation, instead of monetizing tasks.
