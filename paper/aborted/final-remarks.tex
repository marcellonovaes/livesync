The LiveSync tool allows users to watch live video streams from multiple sources synchronized. If the videos are not synchronized, user can contribute and synchronize them- selves the videos and help building the synchronization, in a crowdsourced approach, believing that using human perception is better than using automatic approaches in this specific case.

Our tool however presents some limitations that shall in the futures be suppressed, such as the number of events that we can follow. Now, each instance of Coupler and MashUps can handle only one event, in other words, we can not cover two independent live events at the same time with one instance, for that porpoise we need more than on instance of each service. Also, new stream services must be added to increase our compatibilities.
