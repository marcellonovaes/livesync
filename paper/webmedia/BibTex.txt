    ABSTRACT="This work presents a tool that allows users to synchronize live videos from multiple sources such as YouTube or any other video streaming sources. The proposed approach to proceed the multiple camera video synchronization is based in crowdsourcing techniques, using the power of a crowd of collaborators to synchronize videos, requiring from each user the sync of only a pairs of videos. Additional sync relations are inferred from the known contributions, using transitivity properties and an appropriate structure for this inference, the Dynamic Alignment List.",
