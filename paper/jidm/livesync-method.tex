Video live streams are associated to real-time delivery, so it is an important characteristic of LiveSync allow users to play the streams while attempt to find synchronization points between then. In this way, users can consume this live content while performing their contribution tasks.

When performing a synchronizing task, the user don't need analyses entire videos seeking for synchronization point. An user can simply use the buttons Play and Pause on the video player until both videos are playing synchronously. Once the user archived a local synchronism to a pair of videos, the application measure the delay between them and registers it as a $\Delta{time}$ contribution. All contributions are registered, and used as input to calculate the delay between each pair of videos that will likely satisfy users.

As soon as a pair of videos are synchronized, the application registers this synchronization and align the videos in a visualization interface with the other synchronized videos. So, anyone may access this view and watch the synchronized videos in an aligned view.
