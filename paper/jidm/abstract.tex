This work features LiveSync, a method that allows users to synchronize live video-streams from multiple sources, such as YouTube, Vimeo and various other video streaming platforms.The proposed method aims to cover a scenarios where automatic techniques face difficulties to provide correct video synchronization: multiple users capturing videos on the same event, and streaming them through different platforms. LiveSync is based on the humans' ability on associating heterogeneous videos using their intelligence. This method adopt a hybrid strategy, synchronizing a set of video streams by aggregating user contributions that consist in identify a temporal delay between a pair of videos. The outcome from this process is the temporal alignment of the video streams, allowing to generate synchronized mosaics from subsets of these videos.  Also introduced it is the Web application LiveSync Tool to support its use, as well is presented the Dynamic Alignment List, an abstract datatype defined to store and to manege the contributions, as well to perform relevant operations over these data, such as to infer additional synchronization points by using transitivity properties. The usage of this tool in real video synchronization scenarios is also presented in the paper.
