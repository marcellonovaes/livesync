This work features LiveSync, a method that allows users to synchronize live video streams from multiple sources, such as YouTube and various other video streaming platforms. In addition, the Web application LiveSync Tool is introduced for ease its use. The proposed method for pursuing multi-camera video streaming synchronization is based on a crowdsourcing approach, using the human processing-power of a crowd of contributors to synchronize videos, requiring each user to find only one synchronization point for a single pair of video streams. Additional synchronization points are inferred from the processed contributions, using transitivity properties and an appropriate structure to perform this inference, the Dynamic Alignment List.
