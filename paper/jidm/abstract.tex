This work presents a method that allows users to synchronize live video streams from multiple sources, such as YouTube and several other video streaming sources, as well as a web application for ease its use. The proposed method for pursuing multi-camera video streaming synchronization is based on a crowdsourcing approach, using the human processing-power of a crowd of contributors to synchronize videos, requiring each user to find only one synchronization point for a single couple of video streams. Additional synchronization is inferred from the processed contributions, using transitivity properties and an appropriate structure for this inference, the Dynamic Alignment List.
