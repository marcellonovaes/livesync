This paper extends the previous work \cite{delivesync} that won the prize of best tool in the XVI Workshop on Tools and Applications (WFA) of the XXII Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and Web Systems (WebMedia 2016).

Multiple camera video synchronization is a research area within multimedia. Automatic video synchronization (AVS) is a form to synchronize multiple video streams. AVS can be done analysing video segments \cite{wang2014videosnapping} or audio ones \cite{su2012making}. In Schweiger et.al.\cite{schweiger2013fully} we find these and other approaches in the area. One main contribution of this paper is the description of the challenges for automatic synchronization algorithms: wide baselines, camera motion, dynamic backgrounds and Occlusions.

We propose in this work the use of crowdosurcing techniques to synchronize these videos, instead of an automatic one. Crowdsourcing\cite{howe2006rise} in our scope refers to the use of the crowd as part of a computational problem that can be solved easily by a human than by a machine. The "easily" word can mean that the human approach: is cheaper, faster or can be done more efficiently by humans.

In video synchronization, we know that humans can ful- fil all challenges presented by \cite{schweiger2013fully}. A person can identify if two videos are synchronized or not independently of occlusions, change of the background, camera motion or view point changes. The main challenge is how to use the human abilities to synchronize the videos, and permit that other persons can benefit from these contributions. So our tool uses the power of the crowd to synchronize live streaming videos and provide a form that other persons that want to watch those videos can receive both videos and synchronization info.

The remaining of this paper is presented as follows: section 2 explains our approach to synchronize videos; section 3 details our tool; section 4 presents a larger experiment to validate our tool in a more comprehensive application scenario ;and section 5 presents our final remarks.
