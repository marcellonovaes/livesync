LiveSync is a method that aims achieve UGV live streams synchronization. The focus of this method is cover the scenarios where automatic techniques facing problems to work properly. The approach adopted in LiveSync is to use do work-power of a crowd of contributors to executing small tasks generally easy for humans but hard to machines, registering these contributions and using it to determine the synchronization points between videos. This approach assume that human perception is better than automatic techniques to synchronize heterogenous and non standardized UGV.

The LiveSync Tool is a Web implementation for LiveSync that allows users contribute in UGV live streaming synchronization processes, as well to watch synchronized UGV live streams from multiple sources. However, this tool presents some limitations that shall in the futures be suppressed, such as the number of events that we can follow. Now, each instance of Coupler and mash-ups can handle only one event, in other words, we can not cover two independent live events at the same time with one instance, for that porpoise we need more than on instance of each service. Also, new stream services must be added to increase our compatibilities.
