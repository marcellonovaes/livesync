Live synchronization includes the scenario where a viewer has access to an event that is live streamed by more than one content generator. These content generators are independent, so their videos do not have initial resources that allow their automatic synchronization to viewers, requiring a video analysis to generate synchronization points (Couplers). This synchronization fits as a problem that can be solved by using the power of the crowd. This occurs because videos are generated independently, without synchronization points and without previous description of what is about to be shown in screen, neither how can it be correlated to other videos. This way, human perception is used in real time to generate unknown synchronization points. 

As example for this scenario, we can take a public manifestation. In the event, multiple people can take their cell phones and start streaming the event. In their house, other people can watch their videos. However, the multiple videos from different source will be asynchronous. We need then a way to synchronize the UGV. We use the crowd to achieve it. To this objective we group all videos in a mashup application that connects to a coupler server that contains all synchronization data. Both synchronizing and playing the videos are made using this mashup, that can receive videos from multiple sources.
