Content Providers are third-parties videos streamers platforms, such as YouTube Live, LiveStream, TwitCast, Twitch and Ustream. LiveSync Tool supports different platforms as video sources, maximizing the number of videos streams that can be related to an event.

There are two requirements that a Content Provider must attend to be compatible with LiveSync: Remote Player and Uptime Support.

As each flow platform uses its own protocols, the embedded players are required for aggregation in the mash-up application. These players must provide buttons to play, pause and stop actions.

Uptime Support, is necessary to find the temporal couplers to video streams. Uptime is the time passed since the beginning of the live stream until the video part being presented in the player at the moment of the call.
