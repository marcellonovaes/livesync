Content Providers are third-parties videos streamers platforms. There are multiple Live Video Stream applications in the market, such as YouTube Live, LiveStream, TwitCast, Twitch and Ustream. One of our objective was to allow the use of different platforms as video sources, so we maximize the number of videos for an event and allow the use of already in market platforms. A Content Provider needs two requisites to be compatible with LiveSync: a Remote Player and Uptime Support. As each stream platform uses their own protocols, we opt to use their embeddable players into a mash-up application. These players must allow us to play, pause and stop the video stream. The second requisite, Uptime Support, is necessary to find the couplers among the videos. Uptime is the time passed since the beginning of the live stream until the video part being presented in the player at the moment of the call.
